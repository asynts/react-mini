### Notes

-   I am adding `id` attributes to make it easier to describe what happens, they are not visible to the algorithm.

-   We are always iterating through the new tree and using the old as reference.

-   ```jsx
    let before =
    (<div id="1">
        <Foo id="2" />
        <Bar id="3" />
    </div>);

    let after =
    (<div id="1">
        <Bar id="3" newparam="x" />
    </div>);
    ```

    Procedure:

    -   #1 matches

        -   Update #1, no changes.

        -   Visit children of #1.

            -   #3 doesn't match

                -   Search the old tree for #3 without advancing.

                    -   Found #3

                        -   Advance old tree.

                        -   Update #3, add new attribute.

-   ```jsx
    let before =
    (<div id="1">
        <Bar id="3" param="x" />
    </div>);

    let after =
    (<div id="1">
        <Foo id="2" />
        <Bar id="3" />
    </div>);
    ```

    -   #1 matches.

        -   Update #1, no changes.

        -   Visit children of #1.

            -   #2 doesn't match.

                -   Search the old tree for #2 without advancing.

                    -   Couldn't find #2.

                        -   Create new #2 (nested).

            -   #3 matches.

                -   Update #3, remove attribute.

-   ```jsx
    let before =
    (<div id="1">
        <div id="2">
            <Foo id="3" />
        </div>
    </div>)

    let after =
    (<div id="1">
        <Foo id="3" />
    </div>)
    ```

    -   #1 matches.

        -   Update #1, no changes.

        -   Visit children of #1.

            -   #3 doesn't match.

                -   Search the old tree for #3 without advancing.

                    -   Couldn't find #3.

                        -   Create new #3 (nested).

-   ```jsx
    let before =
    ();

    let after =
    (<div id="1">
        <Foo id="2" />
    </div>);
    ```

    -   #1 doesn't match.

        -   Search old tree for #1

            -   Couldn't find #1.

                -   Create new #1 (nested).

-   Representation:

    -   We are provided a `StateNode` of the previous render.
    
        ```none
        // Keeps the state that can be accessed with 'useState'.
        // For each render, we create a copy but reference the old version.
        Store {
            previousStore: Store?
            data: list[object]

            clone(): Store
        }

        // Each render is provided with a 'Node' of the previous render that we are reconciling with.
        Node {
        }

        ComponentNode : Node {
            componentFunction: function
            properties: map[string, object]
            children: list[Node]

            data: Store
        }

        TextNode : Node {
            text: string
        }

        HtmlNode : Node {
            elementType: string
            properties: map[string, object]
            children: list[Node]
        }
        ```

-   We resolve all the `ComponentNode`s until we only have `HtmlNode` objects, then we update the DOM?

    Alternatively, we could compute what changes we need to make.

    Or we could make the changes on the fly.

-   Honestly, I don't know how the separation between reconciliation and commit helps us.
    We have to do the whole thing again to figure out which HTML elements to keep.

    I think this is more of an optimization that I don't need, I should update the elements in parallel.
